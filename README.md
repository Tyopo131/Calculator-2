I know my code might not be the greatest, but it's my first time making something like this.


Either way, I would greatly appreciate it if you could report any bugs to the Github issues page (in case that wasn't clear already.) As long as there aren't too many bug reports I should reply. If I don't, then I'm probably busy with another project.

by the way open it in visual studio.

Please don't report unoptimised code to the issues page unless you have a fix for it.

If you do have a fix, please fork the repo and once fixed, create a pull request.
